MathJax Sandbox
---

This is a javascript application which makes it easy to share snippets of math over the web. Using the excellent [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org) library, inputted LaTeX is rendered in real time. This is useful for, e.g., previewing posts to [Math Stack Exchange](http://math.stackexchange.com). When a snippet is  rendered, a shareable link is generated (assuming the site is hosted on a public server), whose URL hash is a base64-encoded copy of the input LaTeX.

An open-access deployment is available at http://jonathan.bergknoff.com/misc/mathjax.htm .
